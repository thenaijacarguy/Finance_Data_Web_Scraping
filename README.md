# Finance_Data_Web_Scraping
This project involves scraping the financial details of the top banks in the world from the Wikipedia page. The name and market cap variables were assigned to individual columns in an empty DataFrame and the details needed to populate the rows were scraped off the internet using the Requests and BeautifulSoup libraries.

The finished file was then saved into a JSON file for further analysis.
